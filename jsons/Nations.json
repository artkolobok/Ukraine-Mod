		"startIntroPart1": "Hail, brave Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host. A Ukrainian, you were born in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and after being captured by the Ottoman Empire, you were loyal to the Commonwealth, being a registered Cossack. However, after the weak king refused to intervene after your property and wife were lost to a powerful magnate in the Czapli≈Ñski Affair, you did not give up. You fought for your rights and, seeking help with your Cossack allies after your Polish ones refused to act, you went to war with the Commonwealth, for the good of all Cossacks. Seeking foreign help, you allied with the Tatars, who proved to be unreliable, and thus, you made one of the most consequential decisions of your lifetime, to side with Moscow. The alliance was uneasy, and often you struggled with the relationship, however, it left your people with far much autonomy.",
